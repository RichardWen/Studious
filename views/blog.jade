              | Coming off of around three false starts on this project, I'm glad that I've actually gotten going
              | on a relatively good start. With a chat and blackboard both operating as intended, the web app is set
              | to keep growing. I've decided to start keeping a blog in order to track my thoughts on the project and
              | what my goals are and what I learn to achieve them. The blog also helps break up the monotony of starting
              | at HTML/CSS/Javascript all day, so it's a welcome reprieve.

                | Studious was born out of my frustration with getting asked for math/physics help over messenger. I hate having to
                | parse stupid amounts of text to understand what my friend is asking about when they're messaging me an
                | equation they can't solve. Voice calling through Skype didn't much help because it's a pain in the ass
                | to describe things like Force Diagrams without having the ability. Thus, Studious came to life.
              p
                | A live Blackboard, LaTeX supported chat, and basic chat features to still enable communcication. Those
                | are the three big features that I'm hoping to implement on Studious and am progressing to do so.

                | So much done in the first week. After bashing my head at building a few other web apps, I discovered
                | the Pubnub API which I realized would be perfect for this project. Pubnub is interesting in that
                | envoking an instance of Pubnub simply allows an application access to Pubnub functions, which runs
                | against what I'm commonly used to when creating outside objects. Thanks in large part to some Quick Start
                | guides and detailed tutorials, I had a chat and Blackboard up within a few days of learning how to use it.
                | This has also been an app subject to hella front-end work. I decided to use a HTML template to allow me
                | the chance to quickly get into playing around with the Pubnub API, but still wound up having to finable
                | objects/CSS to keep things looking nice. Shout outs to my friend Aaron who gave me some advice on how to
                | handle the chat scrolling in a clean, effective manner
